# Customer-Segment-Spend-Analysis-using-Hypothesis-Testing
## Overview
This project analyzes customer behavior using statistical hypothesis testing techniques. It includes detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and applies various t-tests and ANOVA to derive business insights. The dataset (`cust_seg.csv`) includes post-campaign usage, pre-campaign usage, gender-based spending, and segmentation data.

## Key Analyses Performed

1. **One-sample t-test**  
   - Goal: To check if customer post-campaign spend has significantly increased compared to a population mean of 50.

2. **Two-sample paired t-test**  
   - Goal: To compare average spend before and after the campaign to check campaign effectiveness.

3. **Independent t-test**  
   - Goal: To check if there's a significant difference in spending between male and female customers.

4. **ANOVA** (suggested by segment analysis)  
   - Goal: To test whether mean spends differ significantly across multiple customer segments.
